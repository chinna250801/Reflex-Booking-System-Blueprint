  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=appointment_db \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:15

# 2. Create tables
python -c "from app.db import create_db_and_tables; create_db_and_tables()"

# 3. Seed test data
python -c "from app.db import seed_database; seed_database()"

# 4. Run app

```

### Using docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
python -c "from app.db import create_db_and_tables, seed_database; create_db_and_tables(); seed_database()"
reflex run
```
