# Enterprise Appointment Booking System - Development Plan

## Overview
Build a feature-complete appointment booking system with business management, provider scheduling, customer booking flows, and comprehensive appointment lifecycle management.

---

## Phase 2: Data Models & Mock Data âœ…
**Goal**: Define all data models and create comprehensive mock dataset for development.

- [x] Define data models: Business, Department, Provider, Customer, Slot, Appointment, AvailabilityConfig, HistoryLog
- [x] Create mock data: 1 business, 2 departments, 3 providers, 3 customers
- [x] Generate 60 days of slots based on provider availability templates
- [x] Seed example appointments (Pending, Confirmed, Completed)

---

## Phase 3: Core Business Logic & State Methods âœ…
**Goal**: Implement all appointment lifecycle logic, slot generation, and validation rules.

- [x] Implement slot generation from availability templates
- [x] Build `book_slot` with validations (provider active, no overlaps, slot available)
- [x] Create appointment status transitions with history logging
- [x] Implement `edit_appointment_time`, `cancel_appointment`, `mark_completed`, `mark_no_show`
- [x] Add provider archiving logic (only if no pending/confirmed appointments)
- [x] Build availability config management (copy previous month, 6-month limit)
- [x] Create HistoryLog system for audit trail

---

## Phase 4: Departments & Provider Management âœ…
**Goal**: Build department and provider management interfaces with full CRUD operations.

- [x] Create Departments page with add/edit/delete functionality

- [x] Build provider form modal with multi-select departments
- [x] Implement provider CRUD operations (add, edit, status change)
- [x] Add provider status management (Active/Inactive)
- [x] Create archive provider functionality with validation
- [x] Build confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [x] Add computed var for provider department names display
- [x] Implement toast notifications for success/error feedback
- [x] Create ManagementState with all CRUD methods
- [x] Test all management operations and validations
- [x] **OPTIMIZATION**: Fixed event handler signatures for better performance
- [x] **OPTIMIZATION**: Improved form state management and validation
- [x] **OPTIMIZATION**: Added proper type hints throughout
- [x] **OPTIMIZATION**: Optimized computed vars for efficient rendering

---

## Phase 4.5: Code Optimization & Documentation âœ…

- [x] Used rx.match for cleaner conditional rendering
- [x] Improved separation of concerns (data layer, business logic, UI)
- [x] Added proper error handling patterns

### Documentation Created:
- [x] **README.md** - Complete installation and local development guide
- [x] **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Backend deployment guide for multiple platforms

- [x] **Dockerfile** - Container configuration for production deployment
- [x] **docker-compose.yml** - Local development environment setup
- [x] **.env.example** - Environment variable template
- [x] **DATABASE.md** - Database schema and migration guide

### Backend Deployment Preparation:
- [x] Optimized requirements.txt with pinned versions
- [x] Created production-ready Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [x] Added docker-compose for local PostgreSQL setup
- [x] Created deployment scripts for Vercel, Railway, Render
- [x] Set up environment variable management structure
- [x] Prepared database migration framework (Alembic ready)
- [x] Added health check endpoints preparation
- [x] Created CI/CD workflow templates
