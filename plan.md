## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT TO REFLEX CLOUD

### Prerequisites:
- Reflex account (sign up at https://reflex.dev)
- Project code ready (all files in place)
- Requirements.txt up to date

### Step-by-Step Deployment:

#### 1. Prepare Your Project
```bash
# Ensure you're in the project directory
cd /path/to/your/appointment-manager

# Verify all files are present
ls app/
# Should see: __init__.py, app.py, components/, pages/, states/, models.py, db/

# Check requirements.txt
cat requirements.txt
# Should include: reflex, sqlmodel, psycopg2-binary, etc.
```

#### 2. Install Reflex CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
# Upgrade to latest Reflex
pip install --upgrade reflex

# Verify installation
reflex --version
# Should show: 0.8.17a1 or higher
```

#### 3. Test Locally First
```bash
# Run the app locally
reflex run

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
# Test all pages and features
# Verify no errors in console
```

#### 4. Initialize Reflex Deployment
```bash
# Login to Reflex Cloud
reflex login

# Initialize deployment (first time only)
reflex deploy --init

# Follow the prompts:
# - Project name: appointment-manager (or your choice)
# - Region: Choose closest to your users (US-East, US-West, EU, Asia)
# - Confirm configuration
```

#### 5. Deploy the Application
```bash
# Deploy to Reflex Cloud
reflex deploy

# This will:
# - Build your application
# - Upload files to Reflex Cloud
# - Install dependencies
# - Start the server
# - Provide a URL for your app

# Wait for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)
```

#### 6. Access Your Deployed App
```bash
# After deployment completes, you'll get a URL like:
# https://appointment-manager-{your-id}.reflex.run

# Open this URL in your browser
# Test all features in production
```

#### 7. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)
```bash
# In Reflex Dashboard (https://reflex.dev/dashboard):
# 1. Select your project
# 2. Click "Settings" > "Domains"
# 3. Click "Add Custom Domain"
# 4. Enter your domain (e.g., appointments.yourcompany.com)
# 5. Follow DNS configuration instructions
# 6. Update DNS records at your domain registrar
# 7. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)
```

#### 8. Upgrade to PostgreSQL Database (Production)

**Current state:** App uses in-memory mock data (resets on restart)
**For production:** Upgrade to PostgreSQL for persistent storage

```bash
# Option A: Use Reflex Managed Database
# In Reflex Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Project Settings
# 2. Click "Database" > "Enable Database"
# 3. Choose plan (Free tier available)
# 4. Copy DATABASE_URL

# Option B: Use External PostgreSQL
# 1. Get PostgreSQL from: Supabase, AWS RDS, Digital Ocean, etc.
# 2. Copy connection string

# Set DATABASE_URL environment variable
# In Reflex Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Add: DATABASE_URL = postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
# 3. Save and redeploy
```

#### 9. Run Database Migrations
```bash
# After setting DATABASE_URL, run migrations:

# Initialize database schema
reflex db init

# Run migrations
reflex db makemigrations
reflex db migrate

# Seed initial data (optional)
# This will populate the database with sample data
# You can customize app/db/seed.py before running
reflex db seed
```

#### 10. Monitor and Maintain
```bash
# View logs
reflex logs

# Check deployment status
reflex status

# Redeploy after changes
reflex deploy

# View metrics in Reflex Dashboard
# - Request count
# - Response times
# - Error rates
# - Active users
```

## 📊 PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION

### Environment Variables (Set in Reflex Dashboard)

**Required for Production:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
```

**Optional:**
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-for-sessions
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

### Performance Optimization:

**1. Database Indexes (add to models.py after migration):**
```python
# Add indexes to frequently queried fields:
- appointments.created_at
- appointments.status
- slots.provider_id
- slots.start_datetime
- customers.mobile
```

**2. Caching Strategy:**
```python
# Cache provider availability configs
# Cache business settings
# Cache department lists
```

**3. Query Optimization:**
```python
# Use SQL joins instead of multiple queries
# Paginate large result sets
# Add database connection pooling
```

# Fix: Check error message and update code
```

**2. Database connection errors:**
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
# Check database is accessible
# Ensure database exists

# Test connection:
reflex db check
```
